# Contributing to ArchDB

We welcome contributions to the project. You can contribute in the following ways:

### 1. Universities and Archeological societies
Collaborations with other archeologists are very welcome. 
- We can decide together whether it would make sense to use the same database or separate.
- We allow forking in case you would like to work on an adaptation with your own team.
- Get in touch at archdb.soc@gmail.com to find how you can use ArchDB.

### 2. Data professionals
We're always very happy to work with data analysts and scientists, and our open source licence covers most things.
- We are here to spread knowledge, and would love to facilitate further analysis. 
- We'd be particularly happy to submit grant proposals together.
- Get in touch at archdb.soc@gmail.com explaining how you intend to use the data. 

### 3. Other developers
There are two ways you can help:
- Feedback on the code in any form is *highly* appreciated. You can send a message to archdb.soc@gmail.com.
